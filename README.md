# Newsletter subscription with PHP

This code created a index.php page with a form that asks for an email address. It then checks that the email contains a '@' and a '.' (dot).

Using a Bootstrap alert, index.php will show a success alert or a negative alert depending on the input.

In a second step, if the email is valid, it redirects to dashboard.php using php sessions.
